## Hi there, I’m Olivia Gallego 👋

I’m a **Biomedical Engineering** student in Madrid with a focus on **AI, data, and digital health/telemedicine**.  
I enjoy turning clinical + operational insights into practical solutions—dashboards, ML/DL prototypes, and clear workflows. 

### 🔭 Current focus
- Medical imaging ML/DL (classification + segmentation) and model evaluation  
- Digital health product prototypes (triage / decision support)  
- Process improvement & KPI-driven operations in healthcare 

### 💼 Experience
**Operations Department Intern — Clínica Universidad de Navarra (Madrid)** *(Jul 2024)*  
- Applied Lean fundamentals to SPECT & proton therapy scheduling: time mapping + bottleneck identification  
- Built **Power BI dashboards** (volume, cycle time, utilization, cancellations) to support reviews  
- Proposed slot adjustments based on observed workflow timings and KPI analysis 

### 🎓 Education
- **Erasmus+ — Politecnico di Milano (2024–2025)**: e-Health, Clinical AI, Deep Learning, telemedicine methods   
- **BSc Biomedical Engineering (Bilingual FR/ES) — CEU San Pablo (2021–2025)**
